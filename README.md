### What Is Microsoft Azure?

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service provided by Microsoft. It offers various tools and resources for businesses to build, manage, and scale their applications and services over the internet, without needing to own or manage physical infrastructure.

### Azure Regions & Availability Zones

**Regions:** Azure is organized into multiple geographic regions around the world. Each region is a set of data centers deployed within a specific geographic area and is designed to provide low-latency connectivity and high availability to nearby customers. These regions are interconnected through a global network backbone. Examples of Azure regions include West US, East US, North Europe, and East Asia.

**Availability Zones:** Within certain Azure regions, Microsoft has deployed multiple Availability Zones. Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within a region that are isolated from one another in terms of power, cooling, and networking. They are designed to provide redundancy and fault tolerance, so if one Availability Zone experiences an outage, services can automatically failover to another zone within the same region. This enhances the reliability and resilience of applications hosted on Azure.

### Microsoft Azure Services

Microsoft Azure offers a wide range of cloud services to help businesses build, deploy, and manage applications and services. Here's a brief overview of some key Azure services:

These services are grouped together on the basis of different business usage. These groups are called domains.

- **Compute:** Virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing options like Azure Functions.

- **Storage:** Scalable and secure storage solutions including Blob storage, File storage, and Disk storage.

- **Databases:** Managed database services such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL.

- **Networking:** Virtual networks, load balancers, VPN gateways, and content delivery network (CDN) services.

- **AI and Machine Learning:** Pre-built AI models, machine learning services, and cognitive APIs for adding intelligence to applications.

- **IoT:** Services for connecting, monitoring, and managing Internet of Things (IoT) devices and data.

- **Developer Tools:** Tools and services for application development, testing, and deployment, including Azure DevOps and Visual Studio.

- **Analytics:** Data analytics services such as Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, and Azure Stream Analytics for real-time data processing.

- **Security and Identity:** Identity management, threat protection, and compliance services to secure Azure resources and data.

- **Management and Monitoring:** Tools for managing and monitoring Azure resources, including Azure Monitor, Azure Resource Manager, and Azure Security Center.


### Azure Services – Compute

**Virtual Machine:** Virtual Machines are IaaS offerings from Azure. It allows users to launch Windows and Linux virtual machines of their own choice configuration.

**App Service:** App Service is a Platform as a Service offering by Azure. This service provides already set up environments for developers for hosting and managing their applications.

**Azure Functions:** Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables users to run event-triggered code without provisioning or managing servers. It's ideal for building serverless applications or integrating with other Azure services.

**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes.


### Azure Services – Storage

**Blob Storage:** [object type] Azure Blob Storage is designed for storing large amounts of **unstructured data**, such as documents, images, videos, and backups. It offers different access tiers for optimizing storage costs based on the data's usage patterns.

**Disk Storage:** Azure Disk Storage provides **persistent block storage for virtual machines**, enabling users to attach data disks or OS disks to their VM instances. It supports both standard HDD and premium SSD disk types, catering to different performance requirements.

**File Storage:** Azure File Storage provides fully managed **file shares** in the cloud, accessible via the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. It's suitable for scenarios requiring shared file storage that can be accessed from multiple virtual machines or on-premises systems.

**Table Storage:** Azure Table Storage is a **NoSQL** data store suitable for storing **structured data** sets, such as key-value pairs or semi-structured data. It offers automatic indexing and is optimized for fast querying of large-scale data.

**Queue Storage:** Azure Queue Storage offers a reliable **messaging solution** for decoupling application components and enabling asynchronous communication. It's commonly used for building scalable and resilient cloud-based applications.

**Azure Data Lake Storage:** Azure Data Lake Storage combines the scalability and cost-effectiveness of Azure Blob Storage with the analytics capabilities of Azure Data Lake. It's optimized for **big data analytics and supports both structured and unstructured data.**

**Azure Data Box:** Azure Data Box is a **physical device** you can use to move lots of data to Microsoft Azure quickly and securely, without relying on slow internet transfers. You load your data onto the device, ship it to Microsoft, and they transfer the data to your Azure storage.
